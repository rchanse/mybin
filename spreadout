# method is a follows 
#  a. insure ~/bin  ~/.vim  ~/.vim/colors  directories exist.
#  b. request suffix for backing up ~/bin
#  c. back ~/bin up and verify the backup matches
#  d. insure the non-bin member are not in bin directory at
#     present (~/.profile ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_aliases  ~/.vimrc
#     FF_acrolist (fast find files by acronym)  mine.vim  colorscheme
#  e. move the current non-bin members into the backup.
#  f. copy overlay this directory mybin or raspbin into ~/bin
#     overlaying existing member of the same name
#  g. move (I said MOVE) the non-bin member to the correct places
#  h. source .profile  or  logoff/logon
#  NOTE on backout  (overlay ~/bin with the backup (see c.) and
#  move the non-bin member to their rightful homes
